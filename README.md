# Drone Payload Drop System based on ATmega328P

This project provides a software and hardware solution for controlling the payload release process of a drone using the ATmega328P microcontroller.

## About the Project

This project is designed to offer drones the capability to execute tasks related to cargo delivery. The payload release system enables precise, programmable control over the moment of cargo release, which can be invaluable in fields such as agriculture, environmental monitoring, humanitarian missions, and more.

## Project Features

- **ATmega328P Microcontroller:** The project is built around the popular ATmega328P microcontroller, making it accessible and convenient for developers familiar with Arduino.

- **Precision Control:** The system ensures accurate control over the cargo release moment, allowing tasks to be performed with a high degree of precision.

- **Open Source:** All source code and schematics of the project are available in this repository, enabling developers to easily study, make modifications, and contribute.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Use Microchip studio or Arduino IDE to compile and get .hex file

3. Write this file to the microcontroller using AVRDUDE or other firmware programs.
